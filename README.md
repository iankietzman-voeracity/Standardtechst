## Description
An opinionated, full stack scaffold for rapid prototyping and iteration of alpha and beta products

**Standardtechst** is from the Danish *standardtekst*, meaning boilerplate, with some simple wordplay thrown in

The logo is meant to evoke old bronze typesetting blocks, where the bare bronze shows through on the elevated letter ridges and everything else covered in ink

Currently in initial development / pre-release phase
